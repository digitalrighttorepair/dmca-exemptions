DMCA Exemption Requester
========================

The Copyright Office's form is difficult to use, so we've decided to make it easier. Simply select the exemptions you care about and write a nice message to James Hadley Billington. We hear he's a good chap, so be friendly.

Submissions from the community are stored in our database as well as submitted to the Copyright Office's form: http://copyright.gov/1201/comment-forms/
