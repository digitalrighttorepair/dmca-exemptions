   <h1>Your rights are under attack</h1>
   <h2>Tell the Copyright Office to give us back our freedom.</h2>

   <p>They made it illegal to unlock our phones. But we stood up to them, and President Obama agreed with us. Now they're considering taking even that away.</p>

   <p>Copyright law is shaping up to be the next big battleground in technology. It's fundamentally redefining ownership. And there's something you can do about it. Right now.</p>
   <p>Following on the heels of the phone carrier's defeated campaign to criminalize cell phone unlocking, the Copyright Office is considering opening up a number of additional freedoms.</p>
   <p>But they'll only grant them (freedoms we should have by default) if we can demonstrate 'overwhelming market need.' That's where you come in.</p>

   <h3>But I heard the copyright office already made a comment form</h3>
   <p>The copyright office made <a href="http://copyright.gov/1201/comment-forms/">their own form</a> for submitting comments, but it's cumbersome. (They make it difficult comment on more than one exemption).</p>

   <p>The copyright office is also accepting video submissions! Burn your video to a DVD and mailed it to:</p>

   <p>The Copyright Office wants to know how to contact you in case they need to follow up on your comments. We don't know why they're <a href="http://copyright.gov/1201/comment-forms/">requiring a mailing address</a> for each comment, but they are. And hey&mdash;no one said freedom was free.</p>
