   <h1>Your rights are under attack</h1>
   <h2>Tell the Copyright Office to fix the DMCA.</h2>

   <p>They made it illegal to unlock our phones. But we stood up to them, and President Obama agreed with us. Now they're considering taking even that away.</p>

   <p>Copyright law is shaping up to be the next big battleground in technology. It's fundamentally redefining ownership. And there's something you can do about it. Right now.</p>
   <p>Following on the heels of the phone carrier's defeated campaign to criminalize cell phone unlocking, the Copyright Office is considering opening up a number of additional freedoms.</p>
   <p>But they'll only grant them (freedoms we should have by default) if we can demonstrate 'overwhelming market need.' That's where you come in.</p>

   <a href="/exemptions" class="btn action-nav">Storm the gates!</a>

   <h3>Didn't the Copyright Office already make a comment form?</h3>
   <p>They sure did. You can <a href="http://copyright.gov/1201/comment-forms/">see it here</a> if you scroll far enough, but it's cumbersome. You have to upload a Word document and they make it espeically difficult comment on more than one exemption.</p>

   <p>So we made their form better. You're welcome, <a hreef="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Pallante">Maria</a>.</p>

   <p>In another awesome turn of events, the Copyright Office is also accepting video submissions! If you want to have an extra special impact, record your comments and burn your video to a DVD. Then and mail it to:</p>
